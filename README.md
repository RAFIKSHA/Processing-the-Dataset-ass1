# importing Packages : 
>This section imports the required Python packages, including pandas, which is a key library for data manipulation and analysis.

# Data Gathering for Operations :
> This section reads data from a CSV file named "india.csv" into a pandas DataFrame named dataset. This is the initial step of obtaining data for analysis.

# Data Visualization: 
>The code then displays a preview of the first few records in the DataFrame using the head() method. It also outputs basic information about the DataFrame using info() and summary statistics using describe().

# Data Checking:
>The code checks for missing values within the DataFrame using the isnull().sum() method, which calculates the count of missing values for each column.

# Data Processing: 
>This section defines a function preprocess_data that splits the "State & District" column into separate columns for district code, state name, and district name. The function is then applied to the DataFrame, and the preprocessed data is displayed using head().

# Managing or Addressing Missing Values:
>The code snippet indicates handling missing values for the 'Age_Group_50' column by filling them with the median value of the column using the fillna() method. The updated DataFrame is then displayed.

# Datatype Conversion: 
>This section converts the 'Age_Group_50' column to integer data type using the astype() method and displays the modified DataFrame.

## Overview

This code is designed to perform analysis and generate visualizations for various aspects of India's state-wise data, including population, literacy rate, age group distribution, religious composition, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
- Splitting the combined 'State & District' column into separate columns for District_Code, State_Name, and District_Name.
- Calculating the total population for each state.
- Calculating the average literacy rate for each state.

## Data Visualizations

The code generates several visualizations, including:
1. Population distribution by state.
2. Distribution of the working population by age group.
3. Literacy rate variation across states.
4. Age group distribution.
5. Religious composition pie chart.
6. And more.

## Usage

A brief description of your project.

## Database Connection

This section explains how to configure and connect to the MySQL database used in this project.

### Configuration

Before you can connect to the database, you need to configure the following parameters in your code:

- **Host**: The address of the MySQL server.
- **Port**: The port number on which the MySQL server is listening.
- **Database Name**: The name of the MySQL database used for the project.
- **User Credentials**: Username and password for the MySQL user with access to the database.

Here's an example of how to configure these parameters in your code:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Configuration
host = 'localhost'
port = 3306
database_name = 'your_database_name'
user = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'

## connecting database
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host=host,
        port=port,
        database=database_name,
        user=user,
        password=password
    )
    if connection.is_connected():
        print("Connected to MySQL database")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        
        # Continue with database operations
        
except mysql.connector.Error as err:
    print(f"Error: {err}")
finally:
    if 'connection' in locals():
        connection.close()

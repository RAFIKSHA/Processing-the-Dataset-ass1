      ***sections***
# importing Packages : 
>This section imports the required Python packages, including pandas, which is a key library for data manipulation and analysis.

# Data Gathering for Operations :
> This section reads data from a CSV file named "india.csv" into a pandas DataFrame named dataset. This is the initial step of obtaining data for analysis.

# Data Visualization: 
>The code then displays a preview of the first few records in the DataFrame using the head() method. It also outputs basic information about the DataFrame using info() and summary statistics using describe().

# Data Checking:
>The code checks for missing values within the DataFrame using the isnull().sum() method, which calculates the count of missing values for each column.

# Data Processing: 
>This section defines a function preprocess_data that splits the "State & District" column into separate columns for district code, state name, and district name. The function is then applied to the DataFrame, and the preprocessed data is displayed using head().

# Managing or Addressing Missing Values:
>The code snippet indicates handling missing values for the 'Age_Group_50' column by filling them with the median value of the column using the fillna() method. The updated DataFrame is then displayed.

# Datatype Conversion: 
>This section converts the 'Age_Group_50' column to integer data type using the astype() method and displays the modified DataFrame.
